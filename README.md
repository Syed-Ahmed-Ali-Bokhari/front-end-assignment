## Getting Started

This project demonstrates an end-to-end (E2E) test for an e-commerce application using Playwright's test framework. The test covers multiple scenarios, including logging in, sorting products, adding a product to the cart, removing a product from the cart, and logging out.

Test Suite Declaration:

The test suite is named @e2e1, categorizing it as part of the first set of E2E tests.
envCredentials stores the credentials used for login.
Test Lifecycle Hooks:

beforeEach: This hook navigates to the application's homepage before each test runs, waiting for the network to be idle, ensuring that the page is fully loaded.
afterEach: This hook signs out of the application and closes the page after each test, ensuring a clean state for subsequent tests.

Test Case:
The test.only method ensures that only this test runs when executing the test suite.
Scenarios Covered:
Login: The user logs in using the provided email and password from envCredentials.
Sorting Products: The product list is sorted by "Name (A to Z)".
Adding a Product to the Cart: A product is selected dynamically and added to the shopping cart.
Removing a Product from the Cart: The added product is then removed from the cart.
Logout: The user logs out after performing the above actions.

Summary:
The script automates key user flows in an e-commerce application, ensuring that essential functionalities like login, sorting, adding, and removing products work as expected. Itâ€™s an integral part of the E2E testing strategy for validating the user experience.
